A project to turn the JMDict Japanese-English Dictionary into an PostgreSQL database interactable through an api that requires an api key to access. Made in part because I wanted to try using technology to make a secure api key, in part because I wanted to see how feasile it was to set up my own Japanese-English individual word translation api so that I wouldn't have to use deepl's free tier for the project kotoback.

It has a simple front-end page

Here is a gif of me interacting with it from the terminal, getting information English definitions of desired Japanese words. It also shows how generating a new api key immediately renders the old one obsolete.
